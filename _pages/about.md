## Passion
  Before entering college, I knew nothing about coding. Started as a math major, I naturally took serveral insteresting intro-level coding classes and I was deeply attracted by the digital world, because I like building things in nature. When I was young  I build Legos with my hands. With 4 years coding experiences, now any I/O interface can be my hands to engineer a piece of software. Therefore, I had delievered a bunch of interesting projects such as a cloud store service, a c compiler and web pages(check out my [portfolio](https://yanzheng1998.github.io/portfolio/)!)<br/>
## Experience
  Also, I gained a lot of precious real world experiences outside of my school. Last summer, I interned at [Ant Financial](https://yanzheng1998.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), the biggest unicorn in China. During the three months, I learned a lot about the dev procedures and high standards of code quality. More importantly, I learned ways of tackling complex problems and gained experiences of collaborations and communications across several teams in a giant company.<br/> 
## Mentorship
  I really appreciate that I had opportunities to work with and mentored by a lot of smart people from Department of Computer Sciences at UW-Madison, Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, Simulation Based Engineering Lab and Ant Financial. Knowing the importance of mentorship, I joined a club matching mentors and mentees at my school, and became a mentor of three freshman/sophomores. After one solid semster-long connection, I helped two of them landing internships in top tier tech companies.<br/>
## Life outside coding
  In my spare time, I really enjoy videos(k-pop, movies, animes, tik toks), music(trap, EDM, r&b, China Style) and sports(basketball, ).<br/>
