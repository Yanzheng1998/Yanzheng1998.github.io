	Before entering college, I knew nothing about coding. Started as a math major, I naturally took serveral insteresting intro-level coding classes and I was deeply attracted by a digital world, because I like building things in nature. When I was young I build Legos with my hands. With 4 years coding experiences, any I/O interface can be my hands to engineer a piece of software. Therefore, I had delievered a bunch of interesting projects such as a cloud store service, a c compiler and web pages(check out my portfolio!)<br/>
	Also, I gained a lot of precious real world experiences outside of my school. Last summer, I interned at Ant Financial, the biggest unicorn in China. During the three months, I learned a lot about the dev procedures and high standard of code qualities. More importantly, I learned ways of tackling complex problems and gained experiences of collaborations and communications across several teams.<br/> 
	In the past, I really appreciate that I have opportunities to work with and mentored by a lot of smart people from my school, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ant Financial. Knowing the importance of mentorship, I joined a club in my school, and became a mentor of three freshman/sophomore. After one solid semster-long connection, I helped two of them landed internship in top tier tech companies.<br/>
